/* Task codewars description: This is a hard version of <a href = 'http://www.codewars.com/kata/56a1c074f87bc2201200002e'>How many are smaller than me?</a>. If you have troubles solving this one, have a look at the easier kata first.

Write
```javascript
function smaller(arr)
```
that given an array ```arr```, you have to return the amount of numbers that are smaller than ```arr[i]``` to the right.

For example:
```javascript
smaller([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) === [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
smaller(1, 2, 0) === [1, 1, 0]
```*/
